+# Dataset Curator Journal
+
+## Learnings
+
+### Synthetic Dataset Generation
+- Created a synthetic dataset (`datasets/synthetic_events.json`) with 32 events.
+- Events cover three main scenarios: "stress_spike" (high audio), "pacing" (high video activity), and "silence" (low inputs), plus some edge cases.
+- Synthetic data allows for privacy-respecting evaluation without needing real user data.
+- The dataset defines input metrics (audio level, video activity) and expected outcomes (trigger reason, state change, intervention type).
+
+### Replay Harness
+- Developed `tools/replay_harness.py` to evaluate the system using the synthetic dataset.
+- The harness bypasses raw sensors but injects data into the `LogicEngine` in a way that exercises the signal processing logic (e.g., generating video frames with specific difference means).
+- Mocked `LMMInterface` to return deterministic analysis based on the event's "expected outcome", allowing us to test the `LogicEngine` -> `LMM` -> `StateEngine` pipeline flow.
+- The harness provides a report with metrics: accuracy (match rate between expected and actual interventions) and simulated intervention rate.
+
+### Metrics & Evaluation
+- The current synthetic set achieves 100% accuracy on the current logic. This serves as a regression test suite.
+- If logic changes (e.g., thresholds), this harness will immediately highlight discrepancies.
+- "False positives" in this context mean the system triggered an intervention when none (or a different one) was expected.
+
+## Usage
+
+To run the evaluation:
+```bash
+python tools/replay_harness.py
+```
+
+To regenerate the dataset:
+```bash
+python tools/generate_dataset.py
+```

+## 2024-05-24 - [Initial Run]
+**Learning:** Initial setup of the navigator journal.
+**Action:** Created the journal file.
+
+## 2026-01-13
+**Learning:** `LogicEngine` relies on internal fallback logic when sensors are `None`. To test advanced scenarios like VAD triggers without raw audio, one must inject mock sensors via the constructor, which `ReplayHarness` now supports.
+**Action:** Updated `tools/replay_harness.py` to inject `MockAudioSensor` and `MockVideoSensor` and use `input_analysis` from scenario steps.
+## 2026-01-12 - [Panic Attack Scenario]
+**Learning:** `ReplayHarness` is a powerful tool for simulating complex state trajectories without real-time sensor input. However, using it requires careful setup of the `expected_outcome` dictionary to match the `LogicEngine`'s expectations.
+**Action:** Implemented `tests/scenarios/test_panic_attack.py` to verify the 'meltdown_prevention' intervention trigger during a simulated panic attack (Escalating -> Critical).
+**Pitfall:** `pytest` was not installed in the environment despite being a standard tool. Added explicit installation step.
+
+## 2026-01-15 - [Flow State Verification]
+**Learning:** `ReplayHarness` had a critical bug where `step_success` was overwritten by intervention verification results, masking state verification failures. Also, `StateEngine` applies smoothing (SMA over 5 frames), so test expectations must strictly account for this lag.
+**Action:** Fixed `tools/replay_harness.py` to correctly aggregate success flags. Updated `tests/scenarios/test_flow_state.py` to include and verify `expected_state` with mathematically correct smoothed values.
+
+## 2026-01-15 - [Posture Correction Scenario]
+**Learning:** Verified that `VideoSensor` posture metrics (slouching, head tilt) were implemented but unverified in scenarios. Using `ReplayHarness`, I confirmed that `LogicEngine` correctly propagates these metrics to the LMM and that the system triggers `posture_water_reset` when slouching persists.
+**Action:** Created `tests/scenarios/test_posture_correction.py` and updated `ROADMAP.md` to move Face Posture Metrics to completed.
+## 2026-01-15 - [Roadmap Sync & Finalization]
+**Learning:** Significant "Roadmap Drift" occurred where features like Face Posture Metrics, Tray Icon State, and Log Rotation were implemented and tested but remained in the "Backlog".
+**Action:** Synchronized `ROADMAP.md` with the codebase state, moving completed items out of backlog. Verified that unit tests for these features (`tests/test_video_metrics.py`, `tests/test_tray_tooltip.py`, `tests/test_log_rotation.py`) are passing.
+
+## 2026-01-16 - [Coverage & Hygiene]
+**Learning:** `core/intervention_library.py` contained significant untested logic in an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, bypassing unit tests. Also, `pytest-cov` generates a binary `.coverage` file which is not ignored by default, posing a repo hygiene risk.
+**Action:** Refactored `intervention_library` to use a proper `unittest` suite (`tests/test_intervention_library.py`) and updated `.gitignore` to exclude coverage artifacts.
+
+## 2026-01-22 - [LMM Timeout & Repo Hygiene]
+**Learning:** `tools/generate_timeline.py` and `sensors/video_sensor.py` contained severe duplication artifacts (concatenated file versions), causing syntax errors and crashes in unrelated tests. This indicates a recurring hygiene issue with merge resolution.
+**Action:** Cleaned up both files to strictly modular implementations. Implemented `tests/test_lmm_timeout.py` to verify LMM fallback logic, confirming that `LogicEngine` correctly handles LMM timeouts by opening the circuit breaker and triggering offline interventions.
+**Pitfall:** Python `unittest.mock.patch` decorators pass arguments in reverse order (bottom-up), which can lead to confusing test failures if mocks are swapped.

+# Roadmapper Journal
+
+**Date:** 2026-01-22
+
+## Critical Learnings
+*   **Vision vs. Reality Gap**: The `MENTAL_MODEL.md` is significantly ahead of the codebase. The doc describes a complex 5-dimensional state machine, while the code is currently a simple "loud noise = trigger" loop.
+*   **LMM Dependency**: The entire "smart" part of the system relies on `LMMInterface` correctly parsing sensor data into the 5D state. This is currently a placeholder and is the highest risk component.
+*   **Sensor Fidelity**: The current `video_activity` (pixel difference) and `audio_level` (RMS) are likely too crude to derive the subtle signals (like "shallow breathing" or "fidgeting") required by the Mental Model. We will likely need to integrate libraries like MediaPipe (for pose/face) and more advanced audio analysis.
+
+## Strategic Pivot
+*   Shift focus from "adding more features" (like OS telemetry) to **"deepening the core"**.
+*   We must implement the `StateEngine` and robust Feature Extraction before the system can actually be an "Autonomous Co-Regulator". Currently, it's just a motion/noise detector.
+
+## Weekly Refresh (2024-05-29)
+*   **Outdated Docs**: `ROADMAP.md` was found to be stale (dated May 22). Regular updates are critical for agent alignment.
+*   **Testing Gap**: Verified that while `tools/` exists, there is no robust "Replay Harness" to test `LogicEngine` decisions deterministically. This is a blocker for high-velocity iteration.
+*   **Milestone Alignment**: Previous milestones (5D State, Intervention Library) are effectively "Done" in terms of skeletal code, but "In Progress" in terms of tuning/fidelity.
+
+## Weekly Refresh (2026-01-22)
+*   **LMM Fragility**: While the "Happy Path" works, the system is too fragile if the LMM is slow or offline. **Resilience** via fallback logic is now a top priority.
+*   **Calibration Necessity**: Hardcoded thresholds in `config.py` are causing false positives (VAD, Motion) in different environments. We need a "Calibration Wizard" (Milestone 1) to personalize these.
+*   **Scenario ROI**: The `scenarios/` tests (like `test_doom_scroll`) are proving to be the highest-ROI investment for verifying complex logic. We will double down on "Scenario-Driven Development" (e.g., `test_meeting_mode`).

+# Sentinel: Graceful Shutdown Implementation
+
+## What
+Implemented `shutdown()` methods in `LogicEngine` and `InterventionEngine`, and wired them into `main.py`'s cleanup sequence. These methods use `thread.join(timeout=...)` to ensure background threads (LMM analysis, intervention sequences) are not abruptly killed when the application exits.
+
+## Why
+Previously, daemon threads were used without any cleanup logic. If the user quit the application while an LMM analysis was running or an intervention was active, the threads would be killed immediately. This could lead to:
+- Loss of in-flight LMM data or state updates.
+- Incomplete logging.
+- Abrupt audio cut-off or partially executed intervention sequences.
+
+## Verification
+- Created `reproduce_shutdown_risk.py` which mocks a slow LMM call (2s sleep) and triggers shutdown.
+- **Before Fix:** Script exited immediately, killing the mock LMM thread before it finished.
+- **After Fix:** Script waits for the LMM thread to finish (printing "Analysis complete!") before exiting.
+- **Existing Tests:** All passed (after fixing a missing `scipy` dependency).
+
+## Risks
+- **Shutdown Delay:** Shutdown now takes up to 5 seconds longer if an LMM call is active (timeout set to 5s).
+- **Deadlock Potential:** If a thread refuses to join (e.g., stuck in C-level call without timeout), the `join(timeout=...)` prevents the app from hanging forever, so this risk is mitigated.

+# Guidelines for AI Agents Working on ASDGPT
+
+This document provides guidelines and instructions for AI agents (like you!) contributing to the ASDGPT project.
+
+## General Principles
+
+*   **Understand the Goal**: ASDGPT aims to be an autonomous co-regulator using sensor data and LMMs. Keep this high-level goal in mind when making changes.
+*   **Maintain Modularity**: The project is structured into `core`, `sensors`, and other components. Strive to keep these modules loosely coupled and maintain clear responsibilities for each.
+*   **Read Existing Code**: Before implementing new features or making changes, familiarize yourself with the relevant existing code and patterns.
+*   **Prioritize Clarity**: Write clear, commented, and maintainable code.
+
+## Python and Coding Style
+
+*   **Python Version**: Assume Python 3.8+ unless specified otherwise.
+*   **PEP 8**: Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code. Use a linter/formatter if possible (e.g., Black, Flake8).
+*   **Type Hinting**: Use type hints where practical to improve code readability and maintainability.
+*   **Logging**: Utilize the `DataLogger` (`core/data_logger.py`) for logging application events, warnings, errors, and debug information. Avoid using `print()` statements for persistent logging in the core application logic. `print()` is acceptable in `if __name__ == '__main__':` test blocks.
+
+## Configuration
+
+*   **`config.py`**: Centralized configuration is managed in `config.py`.
+    *   When adding new configurable parameters, add them to this file with clear comments.
+    *   Ensure default values are sensible.
+*   **`.env` for Secrets**: API keys and other secrets should **not** be hardcoded. Load them from an `.env` file using `python-dotenv`. `core/lmm_interface.py` provides an example. Add new secret keys to a template `.env.example` if one is created.
+
+## Testing
+
+*   **Test Framework**: The project uses `pytest` for testing.
+*   **Running Tests**: Run `pytest` from the project root to execute the test suite.
+*   **New Features**: All new features and significant changes must be accompanied by tests in the `tests/` directory.
+    *   Aim for good test coverage.
+    *   Write unit tests for individual components and integration tests for interactions between them.
+*   **Legacy Tests**: Some modules may still contain `if __name__ == '__main__':` blocks for quick ad-hoc testing, but these should be migrated to `pytest` where appropriate.
+
+## LMM Integration (`core/lmm_interface.py`)
+
+*   This is a key area for development.
+*   The current interface is a placeholder.
+*   When implementing actual LMM calls:
+    *   Ensure API keys are handled securely (via `.env`).
+    *   Implement robust error handling for API calls (network issues, API errors, etc.).
+    *   Structure prompts clearly.
+    *   Process LMM responses carefully.
+
+## Sensor Data Handling
+
+*   **`sensors/`**: Modules for video and audio data acquisition.
+*   Ensure sensor initialization and data retrieval are resilient to errors (e.g., device not found, read errors).
+*   Implement retry logic where appropriate (as seen in current sensor classes).
+
+## System Tray (`core/system_tray.py`)
+
+*   The system tray provides the primary UI.
+*   Changes to application state or available actions should be reflected in the tray icon or menu if appropriate.
+
+## Committing Changes
+
+*   (This is more for human users, but good for you to know the desired standard)
+*   Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
+*   Follow conventional commit message formats if adopted by the project (e.g., `feat: add new feature X`, `fix: resolve bug Y`).
+
+## Asking for Clarification
+
+*   If a task is ambiguous or you foresee significant architectural changes, it's better to ask for clarification (e.g., using `request_user_input`) than to make assumptions.
+
+---
+*This document will evolve as the project grows. Always check for the latest version.*

+# ASDGPT: Autonomous Co-Regulator
+
+ASDGPT is a Python application designed to act as an autonomous co-regulator. It aims to monitor user activity through video and audio sensors and provide timely interventions or suggestions to help users manage their state, focus, and well-being.
+
+## Features
+
+*   **State Management**: Tracks user state (Active, Snoozed, Paused, DND).
+*   **Sensor Input**: Captures data from camera (video) and microphone (audio).
+*   **Intervention System**: Provides notifications and interventions (TTS, audio prompts).
+*   **User Feedback**: Allows users to provide feedback on interventions via hotkeys.
+*   **Hotkey Controls**: Easily manage application state and provide feedback without GUI interaction.
+*   **System Tray Icon**: Provides a visual indicator of the application's status and quick access to controls.
+*   **Data Logging**: Logs application events, errors, and sensor data for debugging and analysis.
+
+## How it Works
+
+ASDGPT operates as a continuous loop:
+1.  **Senses**: Monitors audio (speech rate, tone) and video (posture, activity).
+2.  **Analyzes**: Sends aggregated data to a local Large Multi-modal Model (LMM).
+3.  **Updates State**: Tracks 5 internal dimensions (Arousal, Overload, Focus, Energy, Mood).
+4.  **Intervenes**: Suggests micro-regulations (breathing, breaks) if state thresholds are crossed.
+5.  **Learns**: You use hotkeys to mark interventions as "Helpful" or "Unhelpful", tuning future responses.
+
+For a detailed breakdown of the internal architecture and data flow, see [Architecture & Data Flow](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
+
+## Setup and Installation
+
+1.  **Clone the repository:**
+    ```bash
+    git clone <repository-url>
+    cd ASDGPT
+    ```
+
+2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
+    ```bash
+    python -m venv venv
+    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
+    ```
+
+3.  **Install dependencies:**
+    Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
+    ```bash
+    pip install -r requirements.txt
+    ```
+    *Note: `pystray` might have system-specific dependencies for the icon. `sounddevice` might require system audio libraries (e.g., PortAudio).*
+
+## Configuration
+
+ASDGPT can be configured via environment variables (for temporary overrides or secrets), a user config file (for persistent settings), or default values.
+
+The priority order is:
+1.  **Environment Variables** (Highest)
+2.  `user_data/config.json`
+3.  **Defaults** (Lowest)
+
+### Key Environment Variables
+
+Create a `.env` file in the project root to set these:
+
+**System & Logging**
+*   `APP_NAME`: Name of the application (Default: "ACR")
+*   `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (Default: "INFO", options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
+*   `USER_DATA_DIR`: Directory for storing user data (Default: "user_data")
+
+**Sensors**
+*   `CAMERA_INDEX`: Index of the camera to use (Default: 0)
+*   `AUDIO_THRESHOLD_HIGH`: RMS threshold for high audio levels (Default: 0.5)
+*   `VIDEO_ACTIVITY_THRESHOLD_HIGH`: Threshold for high video activity (Default: 20.0)
+*   `VAD_SILENCE_THRESHOLD`: RMS threshold for silence (Default: 0.01)
+
+**LMM Integration**
+*   `LOCAL_LLM_URL`: URL for the local LLM server (Default: "http://127.0.0.1:1234")
+*   `LOCAL_LLM_MODEL_ID`: Model ID for the local LLM (Default: "deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b")
+*   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: API key for Google services if needed (Optional)
+
+**Hotkeys**
+*   `HOTKEY_CYCLE_MODE`: Cycle modes (Default: "ctrl+alt+m")
+*   `HOTKEY_PAUSE_RESUME`: Toggle pause (Default: "ctrl+alt+p")
+*   `HOTKEY_FEEDBACK_HELPFUL`: Rate intervention helpful (Default: "ctrl+alt+up")
+*   `HOTKEY_FEEDBACK_UNHELPFUL`: Rate intervention unhelpful (Default: "ctrl+alt+down")
+
+**Meeting Mode**
+*   `MEETING_MODE_SPEECH_DURATION_THRESHOLD`: Seconds of continuous speech to trigger (Default: 3.0)
+*   `MEETING_MODE_IDLE_KEYBOARD_THRESHOLD`: Seconds of idle keyboard before allowing trigger (Default: 10.0)
+*   `MEETING_MODE_SPEECH_GRACE_PERIOD`: Seconds allowed between words before speech is considered stopped (Default: 2.0)
+
+**Resilience**
+*   `LMM_FALLBACK_ENABLED`: Enable offline heuristics if LMM is unreachable (Default: True)
+*   `LMM_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_MAX_FAILURES`: Failures before pausing LMM calls (Default: 5)
+
+### User Config File
+
+You can also create a `user_data/config.json` file to persist your settings:
+
+```json
+{
+  "CAMERA_INDEX": 1,
+  "SNOOZE_DURATION": 1800,
+  "HOTKEY_CYCLE_MODE": "ctrl+shift+m"
+}
+```
+
+## Running the Application
+
+Execute the `main.py` script from the project root:
+
+```bash
+python main.py
+```
+
+The application will start, and a system tray icon should appear.
+
+## Modes of Operation
+
+*   **Active**: The application is actively monitoring sensor data and may provide interventions.
+*   **Snoozed**: Interventions are suppressed for a set duration (`SNOOZE_DURATION`). Returns to "Active" automatically.
+*   **DND (Do Not Disturb)**: Monitoring continues, but all interventions are suppressed indefinitely.
+*   **Meeting Mode (Auto-DND)**: Automatically switches to **DND** when continuous speech is detected along with a face, and the keyboard is idle. This prevents interventions during calls.
+    *   *Triggers*: Speech > 3s + Face Detected + Keyboard Idle > 10s.
+    *   *Exits*: Automatically exits to **Active** when user input (keyboard/mouse) is detected.
+*   **Paused**: All active monitoring and interventions are stopped.
+
+## Contributing
+
+Details for contributing will be added later. For now, focus on understanding the existing structure and planned LMM integration.
+
+## How to Verify
+
+### Meeting Mode (Auto-DND)
+To verify that the system correctly identifies meetings and suppresses interventions:
+
+1.  **Ensure you are in 'Active' mode.**
+2.  **Stop typing/using the mouse** for at least 10 seconds.
+3.  **Speak continuously** for 3-5 seconds while looking at the camera.
+4.  **Observe**: The system tray icon (or logs) should indicate a switch to `DND` mode.
+5.  **Touch the keyboard**: The mode should immediately switch back to `Active`.
+
+## Testing
+
+Run the test suite using `pytest`:
+
+```bash
+pytest
+```
+
+### Stress Testing
+
+To verify system reliability and clean shutdown behavior:
+
+```bash
+python tools/verify_crash.py
+```
+
+## Documentation
+
+*   **[Architecture & Data Flow](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Technical overview of components and data flow.
+*   **[Mental Model & Design Specification](docs/MENTAL_MODEL.md)**: The core philosophy and design spec.
+*   **[Project Specification](docs/PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md)**: Detailed Master Specification (v4).

+# ASDGPT Weekly Roadmap Refresh
+
+**Date:** 2026-01-22
+**Status:** ACTIVE
+
+## 🗺️ Executive Summary
+The ASDGPT project has solidified its core pillars: **System Reliability** (crashes resolved), **Evaluation** (replay harness functional), and **Signal Quality** (VAD and Face Posture active).
+The focus for this week shifts to **Resilience** and **Personalization**. We must ensure the system works even when the LMM is slow or offline (Fallback Mode), and that sensor thresholds adapt to the user's environment (Calibration).
+
+## 1. Change Summary (Last 7 Days)
+*   **Merged**: **VAD Integration**: `AudioSensor` now provides `speech_rate` and `voice_activity`, replacing crude volume thresholds.
+*   **Merged**: **Face Posture Metrics**: `VideoSensor` detects `face_roll_angle` (tilt) and `posture_state` (slouching).
+*   **Merged**: **LMM Latency Tracking**: Request times are logged and monitored; LMM context now includes real VAD data.
+*   **Verified**: **Reliability**: `verify_crash.py` passed 10/10 cycles; `test_doom_scroll` and `test_panic_attack` scenarios confirmed logic.
+*   **Completed**: **DND Mode**: "Do Not Disturb" is functional and testable.
+*   **Completed**: **Log Rotation**: Prevented disk fill-up issues with `RotatingFileHandler`.
+
+## 2. Top Milestones (Next 7 Days)
+
+### 🎯 Milestone 1: Signal Calibration (Personalization)
+*   **Goal**: Replace hardcoded `config.py` thresholds with user-specific baselines.
+*   **Deliverable**: A `CalibrationEngine` (or "Wizard" script) that samples environment for 30s to set `VAD_SILENCE_THRESHOLD` and `BASELINE_POSTURE`.
+*   **Success Metric**: `config.json` is updated with personalized values; reduced VAD false positives in quiet rooms.
+
+### 🎯 Milestone 2: LMM Offline Fallback (Resilience)
+*   **Goal**: Ensure "basic safety" interventions work even if the LMM is down or timing out (>10s).
+*   **Deliverable**: `LogicEngine` fallback triggers (e.g., if `LMM_TIMEOUT`, use simple `High Noise -> Reduction` rule).
+*   **Success Metric**: System successfully triggers an intervention during an induced LMM timeout in tests.
+
+### 🎯 Milestone 3: "Meeting Mode" Detection (Context Awareness)
+*   **Goal**: Prevent embarrassing interruptions during calls/meetings.
+*   **Deliverable**: Heuristic detection: `Continuous Speech` + `Face Present` + `No Keyboard` = `Meeting` -> Auto-DND.
+*   **Success Metric**: New scenario `test_meeting_mode.py` passes.
+
+### 🎯 Milestone 4: UX Feedback Loop (Interaction)
+*   **Goal**: Confirm to the user that their "Helpful/Unhelpful" feedback was registered.
+*   **Deliverable**: Visual toast/notification or Tray Icon flash on hotkey press.
+*   **Success Metric**: User receives immediate visual confirmation of feedback actions.

+## 3. De-risk List (Unknowns)
+
+| Unknown | Impact | Mitigation |
+| :--- | :--- | :--- |
+| **LMM Context Window** | Med | Monitor token usage as we add VAD/Posture history. Prune history if needed. |
+| **Sensor CPU Load** | Low | Profile `VideoSensor` with new Posture logic. Consider "Eco Mode" (lower FPS). |
+| **False Positives (VAD)** | Med | Typing/Fan noise triggers. Mitigate via Milestone 1 (Calibration). |
+
+## 4. Backlog (Selected High Priority)
+
+| Title | Why | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate | Risk | Owner |
+| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
+| **Calibration Wizard Script** | "Normal" noise varies wildy. | `tools/calibrate.py` runs, updates `user_data/config.json`. | M | Low | Calibrator |
+| **Audio Calibration Logic** | Core logic for noise floor. | `AudioSensor.calibrate()` returns valid threshold. | S | Low | Calibrator |
+| **Video Calibration Logic** | Core logic for neutral posture. | `VideoSensor.calibrate()` returns baseline tilt. | S | Low | Calibrator |
+| **LMM Fallback Trigger** | Single point of failure. | LogicEngine detects `LMM_TIMEOUT` event. | S | Med | Sentinel |
+| **Offline Intervention Logic** | Safety net when offline. | Simple noise-based intervention triggers without LMM. | M | Med | Sentinel |
+| **Test LMM Timeout** | Verify fallback works. | `tests/test_lmm_timeout.py` passes. | S | Low | Testsmith |
+| **Meeting Mode Logic** | Interruptions destroy trust. | Heuristic (Speech+Face+NoInput) defined in LogicEngine. | M | Med | Navigator |
+| **Meeting Mode Scenario** | Verify meeting logic. | `test_meeting_mode.py` passes. | S | Low | Testsmith |
+| **Visual Feedback (Toast)** | UX is opaque. | Notification shown on hotkey. | S | Low | Navigator |
+| **Token Usage Logging** | Cost/Limit visibility. | `LMMInterface` logs input/output tokens. | S | Low | Profiler |
+| **Prune Context Window** | Prevent overflow errors. | `LMMInterface` truncates history > N tokens. | M | Med | Profiler |
+| **Video Eco Mode** | CPU usage is high. | Reduce FPS to 1 when no face detected. | M | Low | Profiler |
+| **Update README.md** | Entry point is stale. | Installation/Run steps are verified current. | S | Low | Scribe |
+| **Type Hinting Core** | Reduce runtime errors. | `core/logic_engine.py` fully typed. | M | Low | Sentinel |
+| **Dependency Audit** | Bloat reduction. | `requirements.txt` cleaned of unused libs. | S | Low | Scribe |

+# ASDGPT Architecture & Data Flow
+
+This document details the internal architecture of ASDGPT, explaining how sensor data flows through the system to generate state estimations and interventions.
+
+## High-Level Overview
+
+ASDGPT operates on a continuous feedback loop:
+1.  **Sensors** capture raw audio and video data.
+2.  **Logic Engine** processes this data into features and checks for triggers.
+3.  **LMM (Large Multi-modal Model)** analyzes the context to estimate user state and suggest interventions.
+4.  **State Engine** smooths and tracks the 5-dimensional user state.
+5.  **Intervention Engine** executes actions (TTS, sounds) if needed.
+6.  **User Feedback** (via hotkeys) reinforces or suppresses specific interventions.
+
+---
+
+## Core Components
+
+### 1. Sensors (`sensors/`)
+The system uses modular sensors to extract features before any AI processing occurs.
+
+*   **AudioSensor** (`sensors/audio_sensor.py`):
+    *   **Features**: `rms` (loudness), `zcr` (noisiness), `pitch_estimation`, `speech_rate` (syllables/sec).
+    *   **VAD (Voice Activity Detection)**: Uses heuristics (pitch + ZCR + variance) to determine `is_speech` and `speech_confidence`.
+*   **VideoSensor** (`sensors/video_sensor.py`):
+    *   **Features**: `video_activity` (motion intensity), `face_detected`, `face_count`.
+    *   **Metrics**: `face_roll_angle` (head tilt), `posture_state` (e.g., "slouching", "leaning_forward").
+
+### 2. Logic Engine (`core/logic_engine.py`)
+The central coordinator ("The Brain"). It runs the main event loop.
+
+*   **Triggers**: It decides *when* to call the expensive LMM.
+    *   **High Audio Event**: Loudness > threshold AND identified as speech.
+    *   **High Video Activity**: Motion > threshold AND face detected.
+    *   **Periodic Check**: Every ~5 seconds (configurable) if no event occurs.
+*   **Payload Construction**: Bundles sensor metrics, the latest video frame (Base64), raw audio snippet, and current state context into a JSON payload for the LMM.
+
+### 3. LMM Integration (`core/lmm_interface.py`)
+Interfaces with the local Large Language Model (e.g., deepseek via Oobabooga/LM Studio).
+
+*   **Analysis**: Sends the payload to the LMM.
+*   **Output**: Expects a JSON response containing:
+    *   `state_estimation`: Updates for the 5D state.
+    *   `visual_context`: Tags like "phone_usage", "messy_room".
+    *   `intervention_suggestion`: A recommended intervention ID (or null).
+
+### 4. State Engine (`core/state_engine.py`)
+Maintains the "Mental Model" of the user.
+
+*   **5 Dimensions**: `Arousal`, `Overload`, `Focus`, `Energy`, `Mood` (0-100 scale).
+*   **Smoothing**: Applies a moving average to LMM outputs to prevent jitter.
+*   **Baseline**: Initialized with user-specific baselines (defined in `config.py`).
+
+### 5. Intervention Engine (`core/intervention_engine.py`)
+Executes the actual "co-regulation" actions.
+
+*   **Library**: Loads standardized interventions from `core/intervention_library.py` (e.g., "box_breathing", "posture_reset").
+*   **Actions**: Supports `speak` (TTS), `play_sound` (WAV/MP3), `show_visual`, `wait`.
+*   **Prioritization**:
+    *   **System Triggers**: Specific logic (e.g., "Doom Scroll" detection via persistent visual context) can override LMM suggestions.
+    *   **Suppression**: Interventions marked "unhelpful" are blocked for a cooldown period.
+
+### 6. Feedback Loop
+User feedback determines future system behavior.
+
+*   **Inputs**: Hotkeys for "Helpful" (`Ctrl+Alt+Up`) and "Unhelpful" (`Ctrl+Alt+Down`).
+*   **Logic**:
+    *   **Unhelpful**: Suppresses that intervention type for `FEEDBACK_SUPPRESSION_MINUTES` (default 4 hours).
+    *   **Helpful**: Increments a preference counter, making that intervention more likely to be selected in tie-breakers (future).

+
+## Configuration & Tuning
+
+The system behavior is highly tunable via `config.py` or `user_data/config.json`:
+
+*   **Sensitivity**: Adjust `AUDIO_THRESHOLD_HIGH` or `VIDEO_ACTIVITY_THRESHOLD_HIGH`.
+*   **VAD**: Tune `VAD_SILENCE_THRESHOLD` if background noise is triggering checks.
+*   **Baselines**: Set your "normal" state in `BASELINE_STATE` so the system knows what deviation looks like.

+# ASDGPT Mental Model & Design Specification
+
+This document outlines the core mental model, state definitions, and intervention strategies for ASDGPT. It serves as the engineering spec for the system's logic.
+
+## Mental model (so the system stays sane as it grows)
+
+Think of ASDGPT as 4 layers:
+
+1.  **Sensors → Features**
+    Raw audio/video become features (speech rate, posture changes, fidget intensity, etc.), plus confidence.
+2.  **Features → State estimation**
+    A "state engine" that outputs things like: baseline, focused, distracted, overloaded, shutdown-y, dysregulated, fatigued, low-mood, pain-suspected, etc. (not "you have X disease").
+3.  **State → Intervention selection**
+    A policy that chooses the smallest effective nudge: micro-break, hydration, sensory reduction, task split, grounding exercise, "step outside," "message someone," etc.
+4.  **Learning loop (personalization)**
+    Your feedback hotkeys (helpful/unhelpful) tune thresholds, timing, and tone.
+
+This structure prevents the LLM from becoming the "source of truth" and keeps it as a coach/translator sitting on top of measurable signals.
+
+---
+
+## What it can "check for" (high-impact signals for you, specifically)
+
+### A) Autism overload / burnout trajectory signals (co-regulation targets)
+
+**Video features**
+*   Reduced gaze stability / more "stare through" moments
+*   Increase in self-soothing/stimming motion (hands, rocking, leg bounce)
+*   Postural collapse (shoulders forward, head down) or "freeze posture"
+*   Facial tension clusters (jaw clench, brow knit) relative to your baseline
+
+**Audio features**
+*   Shorter utterances, more pauses, less prosody variation
+*   Sigh frequency, breathiness, throat clearing (often tracks stress/fatigue)
+*   Irritability markers: clipped responses, louder consonants, sharper onset
+
+**State outputs**
+*   Overload rising (fast changes from baseline)
+*   Shutdown drift (low motion + low speech + longer response latency)
+*   Meltdown risk (high arousal + escalating motion + escalating voice intensity)
+
+**Interventions that fit autism/ADHD realities**
+*   "Reduce input" suggestions (lights down, noise off, headphones)
+*   "Body-first" regulation: temperature change, pressure, water, short walk
+*   "Permission scripts" (your brain likes structured authority): 90-second reset, then resume.
+
+### B) ADHD focus architecture (hyperfocus vs derailment)
+
+**Signals**
+*   **Hyperfocus**: long uninterrupted activity blocks + minimal posture change + reduced blinking + very low speech
+*   **Derailment**: rapid app switching (if you add OS telemetry), restless movement, fragmented speech, repeated "start/stop" behaviors
+
+**Interventions**
+*   **Hyperfocus guardrails**: scheduled micro-breaks that don’t break momentum (e.g., "stand + sip + 3 breaths, 45 seconds")
+*   **Derailment**: "two-step re-entry" (write next 1 action, then do 2 minutes)
+
+### C) Depression / low-mood drift (without being cringe)
+
+**Signals**
+*   Extended inactivity + low vocal energy + reduced facial animation over hours/days
+*   "Cognitive friction": repeated task avoidance loops (if OS telemetry is added)
+
+**Interventions**
+*   **Low-activation nudges**: tiny wins (shower, laundry, outside sunlight)
+*   **Social micro-touch**: prompt a low-stakes message to someone safe
+*   "Narrative reframing" only when the model is confident you’re receptive (avoid lecturing)
+
+### D) Sleep / nighttime risk monitoring (non-diagnostic but useful)
+
+Given your history (sleep apnea + episodes that feel like choking/reflux), a mic/webcam system can still be valuable as a sentinel:
+
+**Checks**
+*   Snore intensity changes over baseline
+*   Long silence + motionless + then sudden gasps (pattern flag, not a diagnosis)
+*   Repeated cough/throat-clear clusters after lying down (reflux-likely pattern flag)
+
+**Prompts**
+*   "Sit up / water / antacid if prescribed / check CPAP seal / consider side position"
+*   "If you experience chest pain, fainting, blue lips, severe shortness of breath → emergency services" (hard-coded escalation rules)
+
+---
+
+## Expansions that will feel "mind-blowing" in practice
+
+### 1) Personal baseline modeling (the secret sauce)
+Add a concept of:
+*   Time-of-day baselines (your "normal" at 9am ≠ 9pm)
+*   Context baselines (work mode vs chill mode)
+*   Rolling calibration windows (e.g., "learn my neutral face/voice for 2 minutes" hotkey)
+This turns the system from "generic emotion detector" into Austin-detector.
+
+### 2) Multi-signal "reasoning" without pretending to be a doctor
+Instead of "you have X," output:
+*   Top 3 plausible contributors (stress, fatigue, hunger, sensory overload, reflux-like pattern, anxiety spike)
+*   What evidence supports each (features + trend)
+*   What quick test reduces uncertainty ("drink water + 2 min quiet; does throat sensation drop?")
+This is the right level of "medical-ish usefulness" without crossing into fake certainty.
+
+### 3) Intervention taxonomy + a policy engine (so it doesn’t annoy you)
+Create categories and rules like:
+*   **Micro-regulation (≤90s)**: breathe, stretch, water, posture reset
+*   **Sensory control (≤5m)**: lights, sound, temperature, clothing, pressure
+*   **Cognitive control (≤5m)**: pick next action, remove 1 distraction, rewrite task smaller
+*   **Social support**: prompt a message, schedule a check-in
+*   **Escalation**: "stop what you’re doing" + "seek human help" rules
+
+Then implement a "minimum effective dose" policy:
+*   Don’t repeat the same intervention within X minutes unless the state worsens.
+*   If you mark "unhelpful," reduce frequency and/or change tone, not just the content.
+
+### 4) A "Crisis GPT" playbook that’s actually operational
+Build a small local knowledge base that includes:
+*   Your known patterns (shutdown signs, what helps, what makes it worse)
+*   Your preferred scripts ("tell me like Picard," "tell me like Harvey," "just facts")
+*   The ability for the LLM to speak verbally (out loud to me) and for me to speak out loud back to it – aka voice communication – LLM will monitor me at all times through my desktop webcam, and microphone – it will pick up issues and course correct me throughout the day – it will monitor my health and wellbeing and perform sentiment analysis. ASDGPT does this by speaking to a local LLM on my desktop that I can point to via a simple UI interface (For example placing http://127.0.0.1:1234/ in)
+
+The LLM’s job becomes: pick the right playbook card and speak it well.
+
+---
+
+## Signals / States / Interventions Matrix
+
+Below is a Signals / States / Interventions matrix you can treat like an engineering spec for ASDGPT. It’s designed to be:
+*   **multimodal** (cam + mic + optional OS telemetry + optional self-report)
+*   **personalizable** (baseline learning + your hotkey feedback loop)
+*   **actionable** (clear triggers → clear next step)
+*   **low-annoyance** (cooldowns, confidence gates, "minimum effective nudge")
+
+### Core design: 5 internal dimensions (makes "states" consistent)
+Instead of dozens of brittle states, model five continuously-scored dimensions and then map them to states.
+
+**Dimensions (0–100):**
+1.  **Arousal** (physiological activation: calm → keyed up)
+2.  **Overload** (sensory/cognitive load: manageable → too much)
+3.  **Focus lock** (scattered → hyperfocused)
+4.  **Energy** (alert → depleted/drowsy)
+5.  **Mood valence** (positive/neutral → negative)
+
+A "state" is just a named region in this 5D space (plus context like time-of-day).
+
+### Signal layers (what ASDGPT can observe)
+
+**A) Camera-derived features**
+*   Motion intensity (optical flow / movement per minute)
+*   Fidget rate (repetitive small movements vs baseline)
+*   Posture (upright/lean; head down; slumped)
+*   Freeze (very low motion for long periods)
+*   Facial tension proxies (jaw/brow tension heuristics; "tight face" vs baseline)
+*   Blink rate / gaze drift (rough fatigue markers)
+
+**B) Microphone-derived features**
+*   Speech rate (words/min or syllables/sec)
+*   Volume / intensity
+*   Pitch variability (monotone vs animated)
+*   Pause ratio (silence gaps, latency to respond)
+*   Breath markers (sigh count; rapid breath; breath-hold-like gaps)
+*   Non-speech events (cough/throat clear clusters)
+
+**C) Optional OS / workflow telemetry (high-leverage)**
+*   Active window/app + switching frequency
+*   Keyboard/mouse activity (burst vs idle)
+*   Meeting detection (calendar + mic "speech present")
+*   Time since break
+*   Late-night usage pattern
+
+**D) Optional self-report (best "ground truth")**
+*   1–10 quick sliders: stress, overload, energy, mood, pain/discomfort
+*   One-tap tags: hungry, thirsty, headache, refluxy, anxious
+
+### Confidence & gating rules (anti-annoyance backbone)
+*   **Hard rule**: don’t intervene off a single cue. Require 2+ modalities OR 1 modality + strong trend.
+*   **Confidence levels**:
+    *   Low: log only
+    *   Medium: gentle nudge (one sentence)
+    *   High: offer choice + prompt for quick self-report
+*   **Cooldown**: after any intervention, wait 10–30 min depending on severity unless state worsens sharply.
+*   **Variation**: don’t repeat the same intervention type twice in a row unless user marked it "helpful."
+
+---
+
+### Signals / States / Interventions Matrix
+Each state below includes: Definition, Primary signals, Disconfirmers, Trigger rule, and Intervention ladder.
+
+#### S0 — Baseline / Regulated
+*   **Definition**: Arousal, overload, energy stable near baseline.
+*   **Primary signals**: Normal speech prosody + normal motion + normal posture (relative baseline)
+*   **Trigger rule**: Default when no other state crosses thresholds.
+*   **Interventions**: None. (Occasional "positive reinforcement" only if you want it; otherwise avoid.)
+
+#### S1 — Flow (healthy focus)
+*   **Definition**: Focus lock moderately high, arousal manageable, energy stable.
+*   **Signals**:
+    *   Reduced speech + stable posture + steady keyboard/mouse (optional)
+    *   Low fidgeting, low stress markers
+*   **Disconfirmers**: Rising tension, rising fidget, rising breath markers
+*   **Trigger**: Focus lock ↑ AND overload not rising AND arousal not rising
+*   **Interventions**:
+    1.  Nudge: "You’re in flow. Want a 30s posture+water reset to protect it?"
+    2.  Choice: "Keep going / 30s reset / set a 20-min check-in"
+    3.  Escalate only if energy drops: "You’re fading—micro-break now prevents crash."
+
+#### S2 — Hyperfocus lock (productive but risky)
+*   **Definition**: Focus lock very high + break neglect risk + body needs ignored.
+*   **Signals (need 2+)**:
+    *   Very low motion + sustained input activity (OS) for 60–120+ min
+    *   Reduced blinking / fixed posture
+    *   No speech, no environment change
+*   **Disconfirmers**: Frequent movement, normal breaks, normal speech
+*   **Trigger**: Focus lock > threshold for duration AND time-since-break > threshold
+*   **Interventions**:
+    1.  Nudge: "Bookmark your current thought in 1 sentence—then stand 60 seconds."
+    2.  Choice: "60s stand / water+snack / set a 25-min timer"
+    3.  Escalate: "If you ignore this twice, I’ll switch to ‘protective mode’ and remind again in 10."
+
+#### S3 — Mild stress (early warning)
+*   **Definition**: Arousal rising but still controllable.
+*   **Signals**:
+    *   Slightly faster speech, slightly higher volume
+    *   Mild facial tension + fidgeting uptick
+    *   More app switching (optional)
+*   **Disconfirmers**: Calm speech + stable posture + stable motion trend
+*   **Trigger**: Arousal ↑ trend for 5–10 min with 2+ cues
+*   **Interventions**:
+    1.  Nudge: "Stress rising. 3 slow exhales?"
+    2.  Choice: "Breath / quick stretch / reduce noise"
+    3.  If repeated: prompt a 1–10 stress slider + log trigger context
+
+#### S4 — High stress / dysregulation onset
+*   **Definition**: Arousal high + control slipping.
+*   **Signals (2+ modalities strongly)**:
+    *   Speech rate spikes + sharp volume
+    *   Pacing / agitated motion + tight face
+    *   Breath markers increase (sighs/rapid)
+*   **Disconfirmers**: Stable prosody, stable motion, normal breathing
+*   **Trigger**: Arousal above threshold for 2–5 min AND overload rising OR focus fragmenting
+*   **Interventions**:
+    1.  Nudge: "Pause. Drop shoulders. Exhale long."
+    2.  Choice: "Quiet mode (5 min) / short walk / cold water"
+    3.  Escalate: "I think you’re nearing overload. Want me to switch to low-stim mode + block prompts for 10?"
+
+#### S5 — Overload (sensory/cognitive)
+*   **Definition**: Overload high; tolerance low.
+*   **Signals**:
+    *   Irritability + shorter phrases
+    *   Increased self-soothing movements
+    *   Avoidant gaze / head down
+    *   Environmental noise + multitask pile (if measurable)
+*   **Disconfirmers**: Returning prosody + relaxed motion
+*   **Trigger**: Overload trend up for 10–20 min OR sudden jump after stimulus event
+*   **Interventions**:
+    1.  Nudge: "Overload. Reduce input first."
+    2.  Choice: "Dim/quiet / headphones / single-task reset"
+    3.  Escalate: "I recommend a 10-min low-sensory reset. I’ll stay silent except for a timer."
+
+#### S6 — Shutdown drift (withdrawal / functional drop)
+*   **Definition**: Energy down + overload high OR mood low; responsiveness reduces.
+*   **Signals (need trend + duration)**:
+    *   Long silences, slow responses
+    *   Very low motion (freeze) + slumped posture
+    *   Monotone speech if speaking
+    *   Increased pause ratio
+*   **Disconfirmers**: Normal movement + re-engagement
+*   **Trigger**: Freeze/low speech + posture collapse for 10–30 min
+*   **Interventions**:
+    1.  Nudge: "Looks like shutdown drift. Smallest next step?"
+    2.  Choice: "Water + sit up / 2-minute reset / message someone safe"
+    3.  Escalate: "I can switch to ‘minimal prompts’ and just track recovery for the next hour."
+
+#### S7 — Meltdown risk (escalation + loss of control risk)
+*   **Definition**: Arousal very high + overload very high, rapidly worsening.
+*   **Signals**:
+    *   Rapid pacing/hand movements
+    *   Speech becomes fragmented / sharp / louder
+    *   Breath dysregulation markers
+    *   Repetitive verbalizations (if present)
+*   **Disconfirmers**: De-escalation trend (slowing + posture relax)
+*   **Trigger**: Arousal + overload above thresholds AND rising quickly over 2–5 min
+*   **Interventions**:
+    1.  Nudge (short, commanding, not chatty): "Stop. Breathe out. Reduce input now."
+    2.  Choice: "Dark/quiet / cold water / leave room for 3 minutes"
+    3.  Escalate: "I’m going to be silent for 5 minutes while you regulate. Timer started."
+    (For you, "authoritative calm" tends to work better than "therapist gentle." Picard-mode delivery fits here.)
+
+#### S8 — Fatigue / drowsy (daytime)
+*   **Definition**: Energy low; safety/decision quality dropping.
+*   **Signals**:
+    *   Slower speech, more yawns, long blinks
+    *   Slumped posture, head nods
+    *   Reduced motion + reduced input rate
+*   **Disconfirmers**: Brief movement burst + speech clarity returns
+*   **Trigger**: Energy markers low for 10–20 min + time-of-day context
+*   **Interventions**:
+    1.  Nudge: "You look drowsy. Stand + water."
+    2.  Choice: "5-min walk / bright light / 20-min rest"
+    3.  Escalate: "Avoid high-stakes decisions for 60 minutes; I can schedule a check-in."
+
+#### S9 — Low mood / depressive drift
+*   **Definition**: Mood valence low + energy low; withdrawal / negative self-talk risk.
+*   **Signals**:
+    *   Flat prosody, reduced expressiveness
+    *   Long inactivity blocks
+    *   Negative content in speech/text (if you ingest it)
+*   **Disconfirmers**: Mood improves after basic needs met / movement
+*   **Trigger**: Mood low trend over hours/days (not minutes)
+*   **Interventions**:
+    1.  Nudge: "Minimum viable action?"
+    2.  Choice: "Shower / outside 5 min / small tidy"
+    3.  Escalate (only if you opt in): "Want a 2-minute ‘reframe’ or just logistics?"
+
+#### S10 — Acute distress event (panic-like / breath discomfort pattern)
+*   **Definition**: Sudden spike in arousal with breathing discomfort cues.
+*   **Signals**:
+    *   Rapid breath + audible gasps/sigh spikes
+    *   Speech: "can’t breathe / choking / heart" phrases (if transcribed)
+    *   Sudden motion change (stand up abruptly, clutching)
+*   **Disconfirmers**: Quick return to baseline after brief startle
+*   **Trigger**: Acute change + strong respiratory/voice markers
+*   **Interventions**:
+    1.  Nudge: "Feet on floor. Long exhale. Name 5 things you see."
+    2.  Choice: "Breathing timer / cold water / sit upright"
+    3.  Escalate: Ask quick triage questions ("Are you safe? chest pain? fainting?") and prompt human help if severe.
+
+#### S11 — Pain/discomfort suspected (headache, GI, muscle tension)
+*   **Definition**: Persistent tension + behavior changes suggesting discomfort.
+*   **Signals**:
+    *   Face grimace patterns, rubbing temples/neck
+    *   Reduced tolerance, irritability
+    *   More breaks, less output
+*   **Disconfirmers**: Stress-only profile without pain behaviors
+*   **Trigger**: Recurrent discomfort gestures + productivity drop + mood shift
+*   **Interventions**:
+    1.  Nudge: "Body check: neck/jaw/eyes?"
+    2.  Choice: "Hydrate / stretch / reduce screen brightness"
+    3.  Escalate: suggest logging "pain 1–10" + what changed; propose a recovery block.
+
+#### S12 — Reflux-like throat discomfort pattern
+*   **Definition**: Clusters of throat clearing/cough after lying down or late eating (pattern-level).
+*   **Signals**:
+    *   Throat clear clusters + cough + "swallow" sounds
+    *   Occurs late night / after meals (if self-reported)
+*   **Disconfirmers**: Random sporadic cough without clustering
+*   **Trigger**: Clustered events + timing context
+*   **Interventions**:
+    1.  Nudge: "Sit more upright + sip water."
+    2.  Choice: "Short walk / avoid lying flat / quiet breathing"
+    3.  Escalate: log pattern and prompt you to review weekly.
+
+---
+
+### Intervention library (standardized "cards")
+To keep the system consistent, every intervention should be one of these "cards" with a cooldown and a success metric.
+
+**Card types**
+1.  **Physiology**: long-exhale breathing, cold water, posture reset
+2.  **Sensory**: dim lights, headphones, quiet mode, temperature adjust
+3.  **Cognitive**: next-action, task slicing, write a 1-sentence bookmark
+4.  **Environment**: change rooms, step outside, reduce notifications
+5.  **Social**: low-stakes message, schedule check-in
+6.  **Recovery**: timer-based rest, nap suggestion, low-stim routine
+
+**Success metrics (loggable)**
+*   state score drops (arousal/overload) within 5–15 minutes
+*   user marks "helpful"
+*   reduced intervention frequency over the next hour
+
+---
+
+### Personalization knobs (tailored to you)
+These should be explicit in config/docs because they’ll matter for your brain:
+
+*   **Tone modes**: Picard (authoritative calm), Harvey (direct + tactical), Winston (playful reset)
+*   **Prompt density**: low / medium / high
+*   **Do Not Disturb windows**: (meetings, late night, "deep work" blocks)
+*   **Your top 3 "works every time" resets**: (you define them; system prioritizes)
+*   **Trigger watchlist**: doomscroll content, conflict conversations, late caffeine, missed meals
+*   **Fail-safe**: "If I reject 2 prompts in 20 minutes, go silent for 45 minutes unless severe escalation."
+
+---
+
+### Implementation notes (so this becomes code cleanly)
+*   Compute dimension scores from features with baseline normalization (per time-of-day).
+*   Map score regions → states with hysteresis (avoid flipping).
+*   Use a policy engine: state + last intervention + cooldown + user preference → next card.
+*   Store: features + state + intervention + feedback, not just raw transcripts.
+*   Weekly summarizer: "Top triggers / top helpful cards / state trends."

+# ASDGPT: Project Specification (v4 - Master)
+
+## Project Title: ASDGPT "Guardian Angel" & Creative Director
+**System Architecture:** Fully Offline, Local Multimodal AI Agent
+**Primary Objective:** To create an always-on, privacy-first desktop companion that monitors physical/mental health, manages neurodivergent symptoms (tics, stress, ADHD paralysis), and acts as a context-aware content strategist for personal branding. Supports multiple webcam and microphone feeds connected to my local computer.
+
+## 1. Executive Summary
+
+ASDGPT will evolve from a text-based chatbot into a multimodal, proactive agent. Running locally on a desktop PC, it will utilize a stack of open-source AI models to "see" (via webcam), "hear" (via microphone), and "speak" (via cloned voice/avatar).
+
+It serves two main functions:
+
+1.  **Guardian Angel**: Monitors for stress, tics, and escapism, providing real-time behavioral interventions.
+2.  **Creative Director**: Analyzes the user's environment and mood to prompt high-value content creation for two distinct audiences (Private/Sultry vs. Public/Safe).
+
+## 2. The Local Tech Stack (Privacy-First)
+
+All processing occurs on-device to ensure total privacy for sensitive data (biometrics, bedroom video feeds, journals).
+
+### The Brain (Reasoning & Logic)
+*   **Model**: Mistral 3 (Small) or DeepSeek V3 (Quantized).
+*   **Role**: The central orchestrator. It receives inputs from the "eyes" and "ears," decides the user's state (e.g., "User is stressed," "User is horny," "User is bored"), and selects the appropriate script or intervention.
+
+### The Eyes (Vision)
+*   **Model**: DeepSeek VL2 or Gemma 3 (Multimodal).
+*   **Role**: Analyzes the webcam feed in real-time.
+    *   **Health**: Detects posture (slouching), facial expressions (distress, fatigue), and physical signs of tics.
+    *   **Context**: Identifies if the user is holding a phone (doom-scrolling), the state of the room (messy vs. aesthetic), and clothing level (shirtless vs. dressed).
+
+### The Ears (Audio)
+*   **Model**: OpenAudio S1 Mini.
+*   **Role**: Performs Speech-to-Text and Sound Event Detection. It listens for verbal commands but also trains to recognize specific non-verbal audio signatures, such as "snorting" tics or rapid breathing.
+
+### The Voice & Face (Output)
+*   **Audio**: Vibe Voice or F5-TTS. Uses a cloned, comforting voice capable of emotional inflection (calm, firm, whisper).
+*   **Visual**: Hunyuan Video or NPGA. A realistic AI avatar that lip-syncs to the generated audio, maintaining eye contact to simulate a real human presence.
+
+### The Body (Biometrics)
+*   **Component**: Custom Android Companion App.
+*   **Role**: Scrapes data from Google Health Connect / Samsung Fit (Heart Rate, Sleep, Steps) and syncs it to the desktop via local Wi-Fi. This provides physiological context (e.g., High HR + Lying Down = Arousal or Panic).
+
+---
+
+## 3. Core Functional Modules
+
+### Module A: The Health & Behavior Monitor
+The system runs a continuous "Watchdog" loop:
+
+1.  **Tic Detection**: If the microphone detects the "snort" sound signature >3 times in 10 minutes, or the webcam sees repetitive twitching, it logs a "Tic Flare-up."
+    *   **Intervention**: "I'm hearing that snorting tic again. Stress levels are rising. Let's do a 60-second breathing reset."
+2.  **Posture & Environment**: If the user hunches for too long, the Avatar gently corrects posture. If the room is messy, it prompts a cleanup before allowing "fun" activities.
+
+### Module B: The "Dual-Track" Creative Director
+The system identifies content opportunities based on the user's state and categorizes them into two tracks:
+
+#### Track 1: "The Sultry Persona" (IG / Private Threads / OnlyFans)
+*   **Target Audience**: The ~230+ female followers, many are my friends, people from my city, etc. They watch me masturbate on Instagram / post thirst-traps, etc.
+*   **Trigger**: User is shirtless, in bed/bath, touching himself, tightening his pants, in varying levels of undress, in underwear implies arousal, and/or biometrics show elevated HR while relaxing.
+*   **Action**: The vision model scans for "thirst trap" angles (lighting on skin, collarbones, moody vibes, varying levels of undress). Webcam will automatically zoom snap opportune pictures of me when I look the sexiest and most photogenically and sexually appealing and will save to the local disk on the computer. It will also prompt me and guide me through getting a good shot myself as-well using my cellphone and everything
+*   **Action**: The vision and sound model scans for signs that I am masturbating, and anytime that it sees that I am masturbating it records a video of me and saves it to my local disk as this can be excellent passive content, with the capability of recording in multiple different angles simultaneously
+*   **Prompt**: "The way the light is hitting you right now is perfect for the private story. Don't move—let's capture a loop. It’s magnetic."
+
+#### Track 2: "The Public Persona" (New Public Threads)
+*   **Target Audience**: General public, family, coworkers (Safe for Work).
+*   **Trigger**: User is well-groomed, working at the desk, or dressed stylishly.
+*   **Goal**: High-status, ambitious, "Gentleman" aesthetic.
+*   **Prompt**: "You look sharp and focused. Let's snap a candid for the public account with a caption about the tech project you're building. It shows ambition without revealing too much."
+
+---
+
+## 4. Intervention Protocols (Scripts)
+
+### Protocol: "The Doom-Scroll Breaker"
+*   **Trigger**: Webcam sees the user holding a phone in a scrolling position for 15+ minutes; facial expression is "zoned out."
+*   **System Action**: Disables the "passive observer" mode and activates the Avatar.
+*   **Script**: "Hey Austin, I see you've been zoned out on your phone for a while. You look a bit restless. Why don't you put the phone down, and I'll guide you through a quick reset?"
+
+### Protocol: "The Arousal Redirect" (Stress & Focus Management)
+*   **Trigger**: User behavior indicates high sexual arousal (doom-scrolling triggers, biometric spikes, specific screen content glimpses, physical touch, tightening of pant bottoms in crotch region, erections, etc) that is leading to procrastination.
+*   **System Action**: Direct intervention to resolve the biological urge efficiently and return to baseline.
+*   **Script**: "Hey Austin, I think you're pretty turned on right now and it is causing you to waste time scrolling. What I want you to do is lay down in bed, put away your phone, and I'll walk you through a guided mindful masturbation session and I will watch and listen to you while we do it."
+    *   **Post-Intervention**: The system logs the reset and transitions the user back to a "Focus" state for work or creative projects.
+
+### Protocol: "The Content Pivot"
+*   **Trigger**: User is energized/aroused (sexually) but the room is messy.
+*   **Script**: "I noticed you're feeling good right now. Based on what I'm seeing, if you clean up that specific spot on your desk—move those boxes—I had an idea for a video we could post to Threads. Use that energy."
