# ASDGPT: Autonomous Co-Regulator

ASDGPT is a Python application designed to act as an autonomous co-regulator. It aims to monitor user activity through video and audio sensors and provide timely interventions or suggestions to help users manage their state, focus, and well-being. The project is intended to leverage Large Language Models (LMMs) for intelligent data processing and decision-making, though current LMM integration is at a placeholder stage.

## Features

*   **State Management**: Tracks user state (active, snoozed, paused).
*   **Sensor Input**: Captures data from camera (video) and microphone (audio). (Requires appropriate hardware and permissions).
*   **Intervention System**: Can provide notifications and interventions (currently placeholder TTS).
*   **User Feedback**: Allows users to provide feedback on interventions via hotkeys.
*   **Hotkey Controls**: Easily manage application state and provide feedback without GUI interaction.
*   **System Tray Icon**: Provides a visual indicator of the application's status and quick access to controls.
*   **Data Logging**: Logs application events, errors, and sensor data for debugging and analysis.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd ASDGPT
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: `pystray` might have system-specific dependencies for the icon. `sounddevice` might require system audio libraries (e.g., PortAudio).*

4.  **Environment Variables (for LMM Integration):**
    If you intend to use actual LMM capabilities (once fully implemented), you'll need to set up API keys.
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory.
    *   Add your API keys to this file, for example:
        ```env
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
        ```
    *   The `core/lmm_interface.py` currently looks for `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

## Running the Application

Execute the `main.py` script from the project root:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will start, and a system tray icon should appear.

## Hotkeys

The following hotkeys are configured by default (see `config.py` to customize):

*   **`Ctrl+Alt+M`**: Cycle through modes (Active -> Snoozed -> Paused -> Active).
*   **`Ctrl+Alt+P`**: Toggle Pause/Resume. If paused, restores the previous state (Active or Snoozed). If active or snoozed, pauses the application.
*   **`Ctrl+Alt+Up`**: Register "Helpful" feedback for the last intervention.
*   **`Ctrl+Alt+Down`**: Register "Unhelpful" feedback for the last intervention.
*   **`Esc`**: Quit the application.

## Modes of Operation

*   **Active**: The application is actively monitoring sensor data and may provide interventions based on its logic and LMM suggestions.
*   **Snoozed**: Interventions are temporarily suppressed for a configured duration (e.g., 1 hour). The application will automatically return to "Active" mode when the snooze period ends. Sensor activity might still be monitored lightly or paused depending on implementation.
*   **Paused**: All active monitoring and interventions are stopped. The application remains in this state until manually resumed or cycled.
*   **Error**: If a critical sensor (or other component) error occurs, the application may enter an error state, indicated by the tray icon. Some functionalities might be limited.

## Contributing

Details for contributing will be added later. For now, focus on understanding the existing structure and planned LMM integration.

## Future Development

*   Advanced sensor data processing.
*   User-configurable intervention rules and preferences.
*   Expanded GUI for settings and data visualization.
*   Comprehensive test suite.
