# ASDGPT 30-Day Roadmap

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Status:** ACTIVE

## 🗺️ Executive Summary
ASDGPT aims to be a sophisticated autonomous co-regulator (ACR). The current codebase provides a functional skeleton (sensors, logic loop, basic LMM hook) and now includes a structured Intervention Library and State Engine.

## 1. What Changed (Last Cycle)
*   **Architecture**: Validated core loop in `LogicEngine` (triggers LMM on sensor thresholds).
*   **Docs**: `MENTAL_MODEL.md` established as the engineering spec.
*   **Features Completed**:
    *   **Intervention Library V1**: Implemented `InterventionLibrary` with physiology, sensory, cognitive cards. `InterventionEngine` executes sequences. `LMMInterface` now "grounds" suggestions to library IDs.
    *   **System Tray State View**: Tray icon tooltip now displays the real-time 5D State (Arousal, Energy, etc.).

## 2. Top 3 Milestones (Next 30 Days)

### 🏆 Milestone 1: The "5D State" Engine (Refinement)
*   **Goal**: Ensure LMM estimates are accurate and consistent.
*   **Deliverable**: Benchmarked prompt performance.
*   **Status**: Core engine exists. Tuning required.

### 🏆 Milestone 2: Intervention Library V1 (Done)
*   **Goal**: Replace generic TTS with specific "Cards".
*   **Status**: **COMPLETED**. Library exists, Engine executes sequences, LMM selects IDs.

### 🏆 Milestone 3: "Snooze" & "Feedback" Loop
*   **Goal**: Close the loop. User feedback (hotkeys) should influence future interventions.
*   **Deliverable**: Feedback stored in a structured format that the `LogicEngine` can query before triggering the next intervention.
*   **Success Metric**: If user presses "Unhelpful" (Ctrl+Alt+Down), that specific intervention type is suppressed for 4 hours.
*   **Status**: Suppression logic implemented in `InterventionEngine`. Persistence (saving to disk) to be added.

## 3. De-risk List (Unknowns & Tests)

| Unknown | Impact | Test / Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LMM Latency** | High | Create a benchmark script to measure round-trip time. |
| **Audio Privacy** | High | Verify if simple RMS is sufficient. |

## 4. Backlog (High Priority)

| Title | Why | Acceptance Criteria | Estimate | Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Feedback Persistence** | User preferences should survive restart. | Save suppression list to JSON. | 1d | Low |
| **Audio Feature Extraction** | RMS is too simple. | `AudioSensor` calculates pitch variance. | 3d | Med |
| **Video Feature Extraction** | Pixel diff is too simple. | `VideoSensor` detects face presence and basic posture. | 4d | High |
