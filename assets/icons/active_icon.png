# This is a placeholder. In a real scenario, this would be a PNG file.
# For testing, pystray can often work with a path to a non-existent file
# or a very simple valid PNG. Let's assume these are tiny colored squares.
# For now, I'll put minimal text content that won't be a valid PNG.
# The actual generation should be done with Pillow.
# If I had a tool to "upload" a file, I'd use it here.
# Since I don't, I'll make these tiny text files, and pystray will likely
# fail to load them as images unless Pillow is very forgiving or it has fallbacks.
# This will be a good test for error handling in icon loading if it fails.
#
# For the purpose of this simulation, assume these are valid 64x64 PNGs:
# active_icon.png: A green square
# paused_icon.png: A grey square
# snoozed_icon.png: A blue square
# error_icon.png: A red square
# default_icon.png: A purple square
#
# Actual content for a tiny 1x1 green PNG (base64 encoded):
# iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mNkYPhfDwAChwGA60eADAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==
# I will use this as a stand-in for all icons, just to have *some* valid image data.
# The color difference won't be visible, but it will allow pystray to load *an* icon.

# Green 1x1 PNG (actual icon content should be different for each)
# For active_icon.png
from PIL import Image
img = Image.new('RGB', (64, 64), color = 'green')
